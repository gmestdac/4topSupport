go to   CMSSW_10_6_27heavyNeutrino/multilep/test/sampleLists/
or wherever you put it

create a text file there, named something like
singlelepton_MC_2018_somename.txt

now I'm pretty sure the filename doesn't really matter, but might as well keep the year and "MC" in there for clarity

at the start of the file you can put flags that the heavyNeutrino to store extra info:
+storeLheParticles
+storeParticleLevel
+storeJecSources
+storeGenParticles
+storeAllTauID

You for sure need
+storeGenParticles
and you can ask Joscha but maybe 
+storeLheParticles 
as well

in the file itself you will put a tag referring to some basic skimming, followed by ":" then the sample name/path
options relevant to you are

singlelep
dilep
noskim

since you want all gen info, I'll assume you want no skimming as well:


So for example you end up with a file named

noskim_MC_2018_coronawavefour.txt

in which you have the following text:
+storeLheParticles
+storeGenParticles
noskim:/DYJetsToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8/RunIIAutumn18MiniAOD-102X_upgrade2018_realistic_v15-v1/MINIAODSIM


Now I put "noskim" in the filename so the output will also have that in the name --> easy to remember what skimming was used
If you want to submit multiple samples just put more noskim:/whatever lines under it

Now the actual submission:

go to heavyNeutrino/multilep/test/  in your terminal
run "cmsenv"
then get a grid proxy, run "voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms -valid 192:00"
then run "./submitAll.py ./sampleLists/noskim_MC_2018_coronawavefour.txt"

it might ask for your proxy password again, if so enter that
it might ask you if you are sure? y|n,  if so respond with "y"

it will take surprisingly long per sample, that's normal
it will tell you if it was submitted successfully

potential problems:  
- you have no clue what a grid proxy is --> let Joscha or any one of us know
- submitting the sample failed for some reason
   --> figure out what's wrong (ask for help), but remember to go into the folder named "crab" first, and delete the folder corresponding to the sample you just attempted to submit
  if you don't it will cause problems when you try again

output will appear on pnfs:
/pnfs/iihe/cms/store/user/gmestdac/heavyneutrino
but replace gmestdac by your username

checking the progress can be done in 2 ways:
1: run "crab status crab/noskim_MC_2018_coronawavefour/whatever/whatever"
2: check grafana, it has a bunch of crap so I'll point you to the page you need:
https://monit-grafana.cern.ch/d/cmsTMGlobal/cms-tasks-monitoring-globalview?orgId=11&from=now-24h&to=now
just select your username there and adjust the time to how recent it was submitted
there's always a delay with grafana, so don't expect your submission to pop up immediately
